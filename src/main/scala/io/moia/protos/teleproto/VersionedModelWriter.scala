/** The versioned model writer is a lookup table for the specific version models (ScalaPB classes) for some particular
  * detached model.
  * The lookup table is a mapping from a (generic) version to a the model in that version.
  * Those are combined with writer from that detached model to expected version models.
  *
  * The interface allows to write protocol buffers bytes / JSON directly from the detached model type for a given
  * version that is in the lookup table.
  *
  * The generic version type should be independent of the writing as JSON or bytes.
  * That is, a Mime Type is not a good version type.
  *
  * Usage Example:
  *
  * {{{
  * implicit val someModelWriter: VersionedModelWriter[SomeDetachedModel] =
  *   VersionedModelWriter[MyVersion, SomeDetachedModel](
  *     VN -> vN.SomeApiModel,
  *     ...
  *     V2 -> v2.SomeApiModel,
  *     V1 -> v1.SomeApiModel
  *   )
