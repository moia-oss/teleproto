    * That is possible for matching names if value types `VP` and `VQ`
    *   - are equal or `VQ` is wider than `VP` (copied)
    *   - `VQ` is `Option[VP]` (wrapped with `Some(...)`)

    *   - `VP` and `VQ` are nested Protocol Buffers and a trivial migration can be generated (not yet implemented!)

    * If all values of `Q` can be automatically filled by values from `P` the migration is considered trivial.
    *
    * A non-trivial migration requires a migration function for each field in `Q` that cannot be filled from `P`.
    *
    * To use it, just write `migration[P, Q]()`, compile and let the compiler explain the required migration functions.
